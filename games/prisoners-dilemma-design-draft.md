# Prisoner's Dilemma Game - Design Document

## Executive Summary

A web-based implementation of the classic Prisoner's Dilemma game theory experiment, designed for asynchronous play between two players over 5 rounds. Players share encrypted game state via URLs, allowing play across any communication platform without servers.

---

## Game Premise & Story

### The Setup
Two prisoners are caught by the guards. Each is separated and offered a deal: give information about your partner in exchange for gold. But there's a catch - the reward depends on what your partner chooses too.

### The Question
**Will your partner stay silent through all 5 rounds?**

Can you trust them? Can they trust you? In the shadows of the dungeon, loyalty and self-interest collide. Each round, you must decide: protect your partner or protect yourself?

### The Payoff Structure

| Your Choice | Partner's Choice | Your Gold | Partner's Gold |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Stay Silent | Stay Silent      | 3 gold    | 3 gold         |
| Stay Silent | Talk             | 0 gold    | 5 gold         |
| Talk        | Stay Silent      | 5 gold    | 0 gold         |
| Talk        | Talk             | 1 gold    | 1 gold         |

**Goal:** Accumulate the most gold over 5 rounds.

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Encryption:** Crypto-JS (AES encryption)
- **Compression:** LZ-String
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN or included)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Deployment:** GitHub Actions

### State Management Pattern
This game uses **asynchronous simultaneous choice** pattern:
- Player 1 chooses → state saved, waits for Player 2
- Player 2 chooses → both choices revealed, results calculated
- Next round begins with roles continuing alternately

### Game State Schema

```typescript
interface GameState {
  version: string;                    // "1.0.0"
  gameId: string;                     // Unique game identifier
  players: {
    p1: string;                       // Player 1 identifier
    p2: string;                       // Player 2 identifier
  };
  rounds: Round[];                    // Array of 5 rounds
  currentRound: number;               // 0-4 (current round index)
  waitingFor: 'p1' | 'p2';           // Who needs to make next choice
  totals: {
    p1Gold: number;                   // Player 1 cumulative gold
    p2Gold: number;                   // Player 2 cumulative gold
  };
  gameStatus: 'setup' | 'playing' | 'finished';
  finalMessage?: {
    from: 'p1' | 'p2';
    text: string;
  };
  rematchGameId?: string;             // If rematch was offered
}

interface Round {
  roundNumber: number;                // 1-5
  p1Choice?: 'silent' | 'talk';      // undefined = not chosen yet
  p2Choice?: 'silent' | 'talk';      // undefined = not chosen yet
  p1Gold?: number;                    // Gold earned this round
  p2Gold?: number;                    // Gold earned this round
  isComplete: boolean;                // Both players have chosen
}
```

### Payoff Calculation Logic

```typescript
function calculatePayoff(p1Choice: Choice, p2Choice: Choice): {
  p1Gold: number;
  p2Gold: number;
} {
  if (p1Choice === 'silent' && p2Choice === 'silent') {
    return { p1Gold: 3, p2Gold: 3 };
  }
  if (p1Choice === 'silent' && p2Choice === 'talk') {
    return { p1Gold: 0, p2Gold: 5 };
  }
  if (p1Choice === 'talk' && p2Choice === 'silent') {
    return { p1Gold: 5, p2Gold: 0 };
  }
  // Both talk
  return { p1Gold: 1, p2Gold: 1 };
}
```

## Visual Design Elements

### Payoff Matrix Design
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     IF YOUR PARTNER STAYS SILENT:       │
│  Stay Silent: You get 3 | Partner: 3    │
│  Talk:        You get 5 | Partner: 0    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│     IF YOUR PARTNER TALKS:              │
│  Stay Silent: You get 0 | Partner: 5    │
│  Talk:        You get 1 | Partner: 1    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Round History Display
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ Round 1: ✓ Complete          │
│ You: Silent → 3 gold         │
│ Partner: Talk → 5 gold       │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ Round 2: ✓ Complete          │
│ You: Talk → 1 gold           │
│ Partner: Talk → 1 gold       │
├──────────────────────────────┤

```

### Gold Counter
```
╔═══════════════════════════╗
║  YOUR GOLD:    12 💰      ║
║  PARTNER GOLD: 9 💰       ║
╚═══════════════════════════╝
```

## Interaction Patterns

### Choice Hiding Pattern
- Player makes choice → choice stored in state
- Opponent sees only: "Make your choice"
- NO indication of what player chose
- Results revealed ONLY after both choose

### Alternating URL Pattern
- Round 1: P1 chooses → P2 chooses & sees results
- Round 2: P2 chooses first (in same URL) → P1 responds
- Round 3: P1 chooses first → P2 responds
- Etc.

### Progressive Disclosure
- First visit: Full story + rules
- Subsequent visits: Brief reminder + history
- Always show: Payoff matrix, current totals

---

## User Experience Considerations

### Trust & Psychology
- **Hidden Choices:** Creates authentic dilemma tension
- **History Visible:** Builds narrative of trust/betrayal
- **Comments:** Allows social dynamics (trash talk, apologies)
- **Rematch:** Enables ongoing relationship dynamics

### Clarity & Understanding
- Payoff matrix always visible (no memorization needed)
- Clear labeling: "You" vs "Partner" (not P1/P2)
- Visual indicators: Completed ✓, Waiting ⏳
- Running totals prevent mental math

### Mobile-First Design
- Large touch targets for Silent/Talk buttons
- URL copy button prominent
- Scrollable history on small screens
- Payoff matrix collapsible but accessible

---

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Invalid URLs
- Corrupted state → Show "Invalid game link" message
- Expired encryption → Offer to start new game
- Missing parameters → Redirect to landing page

### Duplicate Turns
- State includes turn tracking
- If player already chose for current round → Show "Waiting..." screen
- No way to change choice once submitted

### Interrupted Games
- No timeout mechanism (games can pause indefinitely)
- Players can resume anytime via URL
- History preserved in encrypted state

### URL Length Management
- 5 rounds × minimal data = ~500 chars encoded
- Well under 2000 char limit
- Use short property names (p1/p2, not player1/player2)

---

## Appendix: Game Theory Context

### Why Prisoner's Dilemma?
The Prisoner's Dilemma is one of the most studied scenarios in game theory:
- **Nash Equilibrium:** Both players talking (rational but suboptimal)
- **Pareto Optimal:** Both players silent (requires trust)
- **Real-World Applications:** International relations, business competition, social cooperation

### Strategy Analysis
- **Tit-for-Tat:** Cooperate first, then mirror opponent
- **Always Defect:** Rational self-interest
- **Always Cooperate:** Optimistic trust
- **Grudger:** Cooperate until betrayed, then always defect

### Educational Value
Players naturally discover:
- Tension between individual and collective good
- Importance of trust and reputation
- Impact of repeated interactions on behavior
- How communication (or lack thereof) affects cooperation

This implementation makes abstract game theory tangible and emotionally engaging through real friend interactions.
