players try to earn the most gold - if both players stay silent, then they each get 3 gold for the round, if they both talk, the both get 1 gold, if one talks then they get 5 gold and the other player gets 0

this is maybe a different type of turn based game than the framework is ready for but I think we can handle it - let's go with this flow

player one wants to play a game and visits our github page and sees the general premise - the story of two prisoners being enticed with gold to give up information about their partner - the question - will your partner stay silent through 5 rounds?  then sees the breakdown of rewards - then makes their first choice stay silent or talk?  then gets a link to send to player two - player two sees the same thing player one saw and makes their choice, stay silent or talk - they see the results and are asked for round two  - stay silent or talk - they make their choice and are presented with a link to send to their partner - the partner clicks the link and is shown the result for round 1 and is asked the question for round two - makes their choice and is shown the results for round two and is asked the question for round three - sending the link back to player two for their round three choice - player two makes their choice for round three and sees the results and is given a field to shout out to player 1 so they will see the comment with the results of this game - as well as the opportunity to start a new game where they are now player one, so the link they send to the other player will show them the final results with the total of all three rounds and the comment from the other player and the notice that the other player has started a new game, and to make a choice, do they talk or stay silent - and the game continues.

there should always be a graphic available that shows how much they get in the different scenarios if they talk or stay silent and if their partner talks or stays silent, as well as how much gold they have at this point in the game, and how much their partner has, as well as the results of previous games played in this chain
