# Prisoner's Dilemma Correspondence Game - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

Current web-based game theory demonstrations require complex server infrastructure, real-time coordination, and often lose the authentic tension of trust-building that makes the Prisoner's Dilemma psychologically engaging. Educational and entertainment implementations fail to capture the asynchronous nature of real strategic decision-making.

### Solution Overview

A serverless, URL-based Prisoner's Dilemma game that preserves encrypted game state in shareable URLs, enabling asynchronous play over any communication platform (email, text, Discord, etc.) without requiring servers, accounts, or real-time coordination. Players experience authentic game theory dynamics through a 5-round trust-building narrative.

### Success Metrics

- **Technical Performance**: URL length < 1500 characters, encryption/decryption < 100ms
- **User Experience**: Game completion rate > 80%, rematch rate > 40%
- **Educational Impact**: Clear understanding of cooperation vs. defection strategies
- **Platform Independence**: Works across all major browsers without server dependencies

## Technology Stack & Implementation

### Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

Based on analysis of `claude_md_files/CLAUDE-REACT.md`, implementing with strict TypeScript requirements:

```typescript
// Required TypeScript patterns for React 19
import { ReactElement, useState, useEffect } from 'react';

/**
 * Main game application component.
 *
 * Handles URL-based state loading, game phase management,
 * and routing between different game screens.
 */
function PrisonersDilemmaApp(): ReactElement {
  const [gameState, setGameState] = useState<PrisonersDilemmaState | null>(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Load game state from URL on mount
    loadGameFromURL().catch(setError);
  }, []);

  if (error) return <ErrorBoundary error={error} />;
  if (!gameState) return <NewGameSetup onGameCreated={setGameState} />;
  if (gameState.gamePhase === 'finished') return <GameResults gameState={gameState} />;

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### High Priority Risks

**Risk: URL Length Exceeds Browser Limits**
- *Impact*: Game state cannot be shared, breaking core functionality
- *Probability*: Medium (varies by browser and data size)
- *Mitigation*:
  - Implement aggressive compression with LZ-String
  - Use shortened property names in state schema
  - Provide URL shortening service fallback
  - Monitor URL length during development
- *Validation*: Test with maximum game state across all major browsers

**Risk: Encryption/Decryption Performance**
- *Impact*: Poor user experience, especially on mobile devices
- *Probability*: Low (modern crypto APIs are fast)
- *Mitigation*:
  - Use Web Crypto API where available
  - Implement async encryption to prevent UI blocking
  - Add loading states for crypto operations
  - Performance monitoring and optimization
- *Validation*: Benchmark on minimum viable device specs

**Risk: State Corruption or Manipulation**
- *Impact*: Game integrity compromised, invalid states crash application
- *Probability*: Medium (users may share corrupted URLs)
- *Mitigation*:
  - Comprehensive Zod validation for all state
  - Graceful error handling for invalid states
  - Fallback to new game creation
  - State versioning for backward compatibility
- *Validation*: Fuzz testing with corrupted URLs

#### Medium Priority Risks

**Risk: Browser Compatibility Issues**
- *Impact*: Game doesn't work on some browsers/devices
- *Probability*: Low (using standard web APIs)
- *Mitigation*:
  - Polyfills for older browsers
  - Progressive enhancement approach
  - Comprehensive browser testing via MCP
  - Graceful degradation strategies
- *Validation*: Cross-browser testing with Playwright MCP

**Risk: Game State Size Growth**
- *Impact*: URLs become unwieldy over time
- *Probability*: Low (5 rounds is finite)
- *Mitigation*:
  - Minimal state schema design
  - Compression optimization
  - Remove unnecessary metadata
  - State pruning for old games
- *Validation*: Monitor state size across game progression

### Business Risks

**Risk: Low User Adoption**
- *Impact*: Game doesn't fulfill educational/entertainment goals
- *Probability*: Medium (novel interaction pattern)
- *Mitigation*:
  - Clear onboarding and instructions
  - Multiple sharing options (QR codes, shortened URLs)
  - Educational content about game theory
  - Viral sharing mechanics (rematch chains)
- *Validation*: User testing with target demographics

**Risk: Limited Educational Value**
- *Impact*: Fails to teach game theory concepts effectively
- *Probability*: Low (prisoner's dilemma is well-understood)
- *Mitigation*:
  - Clear visual feedback on strategy outcomes
  - Educational tooltips and explanations
  - Strategy analysis after game completion
  - Links to additional learning resources
- *Validation*: Testing with educators and students

### Security Risks

**Risk: Sensitive Information Exposure**
- *Impact*: Player privacy compromised
- *Probability*: Low (minimal data collection)
- *Mitigation*:
  - No personal data in game state
  - Optional player names only
  - Strong encryption for all shared data
  - No server-side data storage
- *Validation*: Security audit of data handling
